            <hr>
            <p><b>Because it's good business.</b></p>
            <p>A good user experience helps people engage, learn and get things done. If they enjoy doing this on your site, the acquisition, retention, online self-service and other goals are now in your control.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>Because it's no longer a choice.</b></p>
            <p>Customers are won and lost everyday based on a good or bad interactions online. Good experience design is no longer a check box on the road to development. It is a holistic, strategic approach that affects your bottom line.</p>

            <p>A users experience is the perception that is left in their mind after they leave your site. What perception do you want to leave your users with?</p>
